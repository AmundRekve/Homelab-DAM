## ⚙️ Services

### ☸️ Kubernetes
A self-hosted Kubernetes cluster managed through Proxmox, consisting of one controller node and eight worker nodes spread across all three physical hosts. The cluster is the backbone of the homelab and runs the majority of all services.
The cluster is set up using kubeadm with a dedicated controller VM and worker nodes provisioned as Proxmox VMs. Storage is handled by Longhorn, load balancing by MetalLB, and external traffic routing by the NGINX Ingress Controller.

>📖 Tutorial: A step-by-step guide on how I set up the Kubernetes cluster on Proxmox including VM provisioning, kubeadm initialization, joining worker nodes, and installing core components will be added here.

---

### 🌐 Homepage
A custom homelab dashboard running on Kubernetes. Provides a unified entry point to all services, displaying live system stats (CPU, RAM), quick-launch tiles for each service, and useful external links.

<img width="1813" height="586" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/966cb9b3-6f0e-4e4c-9cfe-303c3d02e9f3" />

Pod configuration can be found in the [`/kubernetes/homepage`](./kubernetes/Homepage) directory.

---

### ☁️ Nextcloud
A fully self-hosted cloud storage and file synchronization platform, a private alternative to Dropbox. Used to sync files between phone and home computer without relying on any third-party cloud provider. Also supports contacts, calendars, notes, and photo backups.

Pod configuration can be found in the [`/kubernetes/nextcloud`](./kubernetes/Nextcloud) directory.

---

### 💪 Wger
A self-hosted workout management application for planning, scheduling, and tracking training sessions. Full gym log with support for custom exercise definitions, workout routines, training calendars, and progress tracking. Full data ownership with no subscription required.

Pod configuration can be found in the [`/kubernetes/wger`](./kubernetes/Wger) directory.

---
### 🐄 Longhorn
A cloud-native distributed block storage system for Kubernetes. Provides persistent storage for all stateful workloads in the cluster with built-in replication across nodes, snapshots, and backup support.

---

### 📊 Pulse
A lightweight monitoring tool used to keep an eye on the health of containers and VMs running outside the Kubernetes cluster. Provides an at-a-glance overview of resource usage, uptime, and service status — complementing the Kubernetes Dashboard for infrastructure not directly managed by Kubernetes.

Runs as a standalone LXC container on `pve`.

---

### 🔒 WireGuard
A modern, lightweight VPN that allows secure remote access to the homelab from anywhere. Used to tunnel into the home network when away, giving full access to all internal services as if on the local network.

Runs as a standalone LXC container on `pve`, outside of Kubernetes, for maximum reliability.

---

### 🌐 MetalLB
A bare-metal load balancer for Kubernetes. Since the cluster runs on physical hardware without a cloud provider, MetalLB provides `LoadBalancer`-type service support by assigning IP addresses from a configured address pool on the local network.

Configuration can be found in the [`/kubernetes/metallb`](./kubernetes/metallb) directory.

---

### 🔀 NGINX Ingress Controller
Manages external HTTP/HTTPS access to services running inside the Kubernetes cluster. Works in tandem with MetalLB to route traffic from the local network to the correct pods based on hostname and path rules.

<details>
<summary>📖 <strong>Tutorial: How I set up the Kubernetes cluster on Proxmox</strong></summary>
  ---
Before starting, you need to have at least two ubuntu 22.04 VMs, added ssh, username, password and given it enough RAM to function.
  ---
<br>

### Step 1 — Install QEMU Guest Agent (all nodes)

Allows Proxmox to communicate properly with the VMs.

```bash
sudo apt install qemu-guest-agent
```

Then reboot all nodes so that static IPs are applied.

---

### Step 2 — Prepare all nodes

Find the IP address of each node before proceeding.

**Update the system and install containerd:**

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade
sudo apt install containerd
sudo mkdir /etc/containerd
containerd config default | sudo tee /etc/containerd/config.toml
```

**Enable SystemdCgroup in the containerd config:**

```bash
sudo nano /etc/containerd/config.toml
```

Find the line `SystemdCgroup = false` and change it to:
SystemdCgroup = true

---

### Step 3 — Disable swap (all nodes)

Kubernetes requires swap to be off.

```bash
sudo swapoff -a
```

To make it permanent, open the sysctl config:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
```

Uncomment the following line:
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

---

### Step 4 — Enable br_netfilter (all nodes)

This kernel module is required for Kubernetes networking.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/modules-load.d/k8s.conf
```

Add the following line:
br_netfilter

Then reboot:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

---

### Step 5 — Install Kubernetes tools (all nodes)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl

curl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.29/deb/Release.key | \
  sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg] \
  https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.29/deb/ /" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl
```

> `apt-mark hold` prevents Kubernetes tools from being accidentally upgraded, which could break the cluster.

---

### Step 6 — Initialize the cluster (controller node only)

Replace `<ip-controller>` and `<controller-name>` with your actual values.

```bash
sudo kubeadm init \
  --control-plane-endpoint=<ip-controller> \
  --node-name <controller-name> \
  --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16
```

**Set up kubectl access for your user:**

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

**Install Flannel as the pod network:**

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flannel-io/flannel/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml
```

---

### Step 7 — Join worker nodes

After `kubeadm init` completes, it will print a `kubeadm join` command. Run that command on each worker node to add it to the cluster.

## 📌 Notes

- WireGuard and Pulse run as LXC containers directly on Proxmox for reliability and low overhead.
- All nodes run Proxmox VE with the non-production repository enabled for latest updates.
